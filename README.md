### MUCH WOW!!!

Look at all these libraries I cobbled together and tests I didn't write!

### SO AMAZE!!!

Check out these commit messages!

### VERY UNFINISHED!!!

Need to add a sync to remote couchDB backend. AKA The Boringest Bit.

If this gets any bigger than two pages, or is going to be used again, re-add
karma to the grunt test task and write some tests ya lazy scoundrel.


### But seriously...

All the good stuff is in app.

Do all the grunt stuff (below) to make it an application

Application will be found in dist

Das ist alles.


## "The Grunt Stuff"

    npm install;
    grunt; #to build once

    grunt serve; # to work on the thing with live reload etc


You will also need a few dependencies, because welcome to front end development:

  * ruby
  * sass and compass
  * probably oilyPNG
  * Here is where yeoman falls down; I have all this stuff always installed so not sure how much of it is used by this particular build. If you find anything extra, add it to the README. Ta.
