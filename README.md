### MUCH WOW!!!

Look at all these libraries I cobbled together and tests I didn't write!

### SO AMAZE!!!

Check out these commit messages!

### VERY UNFINISHED!!!

Need to add a sync to remote couchDB backend. AKA The Boringest Bit.

If this gets any bigger than two pages, or is going to be used again, re-add
karma to the grunt test task and write some tests ya lazy scoundrel.


### But seriously...

All the good stuff is in app.

Do all the dev stuff (below) to make it an application

Application will be found in dist

Das ist alles.


## "The Dev Stuff"

    npm install;
    npm run buuild:all; #to build once

    npm run serve; # to serve as an application

There is also a "watch" task in the npm scripts, but I've not used it yet. Once I know it works I'll document that here.
